            Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net worth of around $238 billion as of September 26, 2022,[4] Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes' real-time billionaires list.[5][6]

Musk was born and grew up in Pretoria, South Africa. He attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University (Ontario) and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided to instead pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother, Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded the online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, and is its CEO and chief engineer. In 2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company promoting friendly artificial intelligence (AI). In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and he founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system and is the president of the Musk Foundation, which donates to scientific research and education.

Musk has been criticized for making unscientific and controversial statements, such as spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting contentious perspectives regarding politics and various technologies, especially on Twitter. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla, which the SEC characterized as false and misleading. He settled with the SEC but did not admit guilt, and he temporarily stepped down from his Tesla chairmanship. In 2019, he won a defamation case brought against him by a British caver who had advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue. In 2022, Musk agreed to purchase Twitter for $44 billion but later submitted a termination letter of the deal, leading to lawsuits between both parties. However, Musk later decided to move forward with the purchase.

        Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a "nano-manager".[176] Musk does not make formal business plans;[177] instead, he prefers to approach engineering problems with an iterative design methodology and lenience with failures.[178] Musk has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, costly and risky projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot.[176] Musk's insistence in vertical integration cause his companies to move most of the production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[179] vertical integration has caused many usability problems for Tesla's software.[176]

Musk's handling of employees—who he communicates directly with through mass emails—has been characterized as "carrot and stick", rewarding those who offer constructive criticism while also being known to threaten, swear and fire his employees impulsively.[180][181][182] Musk expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes for 80 hours per week,[183] which most employees are aware and willing to meet the demands while a few left because of it.[184] He often fires employees in sprees, such as during Model 3 "production hell" in 2018, when Musk also slept on the factory floor to set an example for workers.[185][186] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce due to his concerns about the economy.[187] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[188]

Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[176] and criticized by others as callous and demanding.[182][189] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[190] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as "self-driving", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer lives at risk, some resigned in response.[191] The New York Times characterized Musk's approach as absolutism.
